## 🔍 Project Overview – CSDQD Framework
Link to <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranalishahh/comprehensive-synthetic-e-commerce-dataset">Dataset</a>
### C — Context  
An e-commerce business selling multiple product categories (electronics, clothing, etc.) across North America, Europe, and Asia.  
The dataset spans **2021 to 2023** and includes:  
- Transaction history  
- Customer demographics  
- Product data  
- Discount behavior  

**Business Challenges:**
- Most customers buy once but don’t return  
- Purchase volume is declining despite a wide product range and audience

---

### S — Signal

**Observed Signals:**
- Low repeat purchase rate  
- Declining CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)  
- Low average units sold per customer  
- High discount dependency  
- Geographic concentration in low-conversion regions

**Possible Causes:**
- Weak engagement post-purchase  
- Poor product relevance  
- Generic ads  
- Suboptimal discounts  
- Regional delivery/trust issues  
- Limited variety in key categories

---

### D — Decisions

**Suggested Focus Areas:**
- Loyalty programs or subscriptions  
- Regional pricing and localization  
- Re-targeting high CLV customers  
- Discount strategy refinement  
- Behavioral customer segmentation (RFM)  
- Retention-focused campaigns

---

## 📊 Summary of Key Findings

### 🧠 Context
- Retention and purchase frequency dip after Q1  
- Synthetic e-commerce dataset with demographic + transactional data

### 📊 Signal Insights

#### 🛒 Repeat Purchase Trends
- Global repeat purchase peaked at **21% (March)**  
- Asia trailed behind (18–19%) consistently  
- Avg. purchase interval increased from **19 → 70 days**

#### 💰 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Grew from ~$680 to ~$720 by Nov  
- Driven by Jan–Mar cohorts

#### 📦 Products & Discounts
- All categories had low repeat rates (3–4%)  
- Discounts didn’t lift retention or revenue significantly

#### 👥 Demographics
- No age/gender group stood out in loyalty  
- Drop-off was consistent across all segments

#### 📉 Sales Trends
- Revenue held steady — fewer but **higher-value customers** drove revenue

## 📌 Key Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Segment by Cohort & Lifecycle
- Focus on Jan–Mar cohorts  
- Build loyalty campaigns around them

### 2️⃣ Time-Aware Retention Labels
- Use terms like:
  - "Returned within 30 days"
  - "60-day inactive"
- More actionable than binary “One-time vs Repeat”

### 3️⃣ Ditch the Discounts
- Discounts didn’t improve loyalty  
- Instead offer:
  - Early access
  - Bundles
  - Exclusive content

### 4️⃣ Shorten Purchase Cycle
- Trigger urgency with email flows, reminders  
- Cross-sell based on first purchase

### 5️⃣ Use Behavioral Segmentation
- Group customers via:
  - Recency
  - Frequency
  - Monetary value (RFM)
- Cluster beyond demographics
